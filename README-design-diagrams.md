# 📊 Diagrams & Visual Explanation: ReactJS Todo Application

This document provides a visual and textual overview of different diagram types used to explain the architecture and behavior of the ReactJS Todo Application.

---

## 🧱 1. System Architecture Diagram

**Purpose:** Illustrates the overall structure of the application, including all major components and how they interact.

### Diagram Highlights:
- Frontend (React Components)
- Redux Store (Slices, Thunks)
- Backend API (Express)
- Arrows show data and control flow

📎 _Diagram_: `system_architecture_diagram.png`

> This helps stakeholders and developers understand how the application is architected end-to-end.

---

## 🔁 2. Sequence Diagram

**Purpose:** Shows how actions flow over time between components during runtime.

### Diagram Highlights:
- Use cases: Add Todo, Load Todos
- Actors: User, Components, Redux, Backend
- Emphasizes order of dispatch, API calls, reducers

📎 _Diagram_: `sequence_diagram.png`

> Best used for debugging, understanding async flows, and onboarding developers.

---

## 🧩 3. Component Diagram (UML)

**Purpose:** Explains how components (classes/modules) are organized and how they relate.

### Diagram Highlights:
- Components: App, TodoList, TodoListItem, Redux slices
- Relationships between React and Redux layers
- Interfaces between async logic and UI

📎 _Diagram_: `component_diagram.png`

> Useful for codebase planning, module ownership, and file responsibilities.

---

## 🌐 4. Deployment Diagram (Optional for Cloud Deployment)

**Purpose:** Visualizes how the app is deployed across physical/virtual machines or services.

### Use Cases:
- Frontend on Vercel/Netlify
- Backend on Heroku/Render
- CI/CD pipelines

> Beneficial for DevOps teams and infrastructure planning.
