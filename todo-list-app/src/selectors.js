  Why Use createSelector?
  It memorizes the result so if the input (the todos list) hasn't changed, it doesnâ€™t re-calculate.
  Improves performance in large apps by avoiding unnecessary recalculations and re-renders.

* Memoized selector to get only completed todos using reselect.
 * @returns {Array} - Array of completed todo items.
 *
 * Gives you a filtered list of only the finished tasks.

// Uses reselect to efficiently return only those todos where `isCompleted` is true.

/**
 * Memoized selector to get only incomplete todos using reselect.
 * @returns {Array} - Array of incomplete todo items.
 *
 * Gives you a filtered list of tasks that are still pending.
